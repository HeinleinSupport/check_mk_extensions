description:
 This check monitors the memory usage of SAP HANA. It uses data provided by the {sap_hana} agent plugin, which uses hdbsql queries to retrieve information from SAP HANA instances. To make this check work, you have to deploy the {sap_hana} agent plugin on a host.

 It uses the hdbsql query {SELECT 'mem_rate', INSTANCE_TOTAL_MEMORY_USED_SIZE, ALLOCATION_LIMIT FROM M_HOST_RESOURCE_UTILIZATION WHERE HOST = '$(hostname -f)'}.

 The check is configurable. Thresholds can be applied with percentual or absolute values.
