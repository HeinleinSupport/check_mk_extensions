 This check monitors the disk usage (Data, Log, Trace) of SAP HANA. It uses data provided by the {sap_hana} agent plugin, which uses hdbsql queries to retrieve information from SAP HANA instances. To make this check work, you have to deploy the {sap_hana} agent plugin on a host.

 It uses the hdbsql query {SELECT name,status,value FROM M_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW Where NAME='Data' or NAME='Log' or NAME='Trace'}.

 The check is configurable with the usual filesystem check parameters.
