description:
 This check monitors the process status of SAP HANA. It uses data provided by the {sap_hana} agent plugin, which uses hdbsql queries to retrieve information from SAP HANA instances. To make this check work, you have to deploy the {sap_hana} agent plugin on a host.

 It uses the hdbsql query {SELECT PORT,SERVICE_NAME,PROCESS_ID,DETAIL,ACTIVE_STATUS,SQL_PORT,COORDINATOR_TYPE FROM M_SERVICES WHERE HOST = '$(hostname -f)'}

 The check warns when the process coordinator type is different from the one at the time of discovery, i.e. when the type has switched from master to backup.

 The check is critical when the active status is not YES.

item:
 The SAP HANA instance and process name.

inventory:
 One service per instance and process name is created.
