description:
 This check monitors the Status and Version of SAP HANA. It uses data provided by the {sap_hana} agent plugin, which uses hdbsql queries to retrieve information from SAP HANA instances. To make this check work, you have to deploy the {sap_hana} agent plugin on a host.

 It uses the hdbsql query {SELECT Name, Status, Value FROM M_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW Where NAME='Version' or NAME='All Started'}.

 The Status check is not configurable and OK, if the Status query returns OK.

 The Version check is not configurable and always OK.

 The check plugin is cluster ready.
