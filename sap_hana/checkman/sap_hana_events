description:
 This check monitors the event status of SAP HANA. It uses data provided by the {sap_hana} agent plugin, which uses hdbsql queries to retrieve information from SAP HANA instances. To make this check work, you have to deploy the {sap_hana} agent plugin on a host.

 It uses the hdbsql queries {select 'open_events', count(*) from m_events where acknowledged='FALSE'}, {select 'disabled_alerts', count(*) from _sys_statistics.STATISTICS_SCHEDULE where status='Disabled'} and {select 'high_alerts', count(*) from _sys_statistics.statistics_current_alerts  where  alert_rating >=3}.

 The check is not configurable. It becomes critical if there are open events or high alerts, a warning is issued if there are disabled alerts.

item:
 The SAP HANA instance.

 One service per instance is created.
